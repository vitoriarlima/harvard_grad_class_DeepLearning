Deep Learning - Machine Learning class at Harvard. 

These are my solutions to the class 109B at Harvard in the [Spring 2022](https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2022-CS109B/pages/schedule.html).

The topics covered in this class were: 

- bayes inference
- bayes statistics
- intro to neural networks
- gradient descent, backpropagation
- optimizers
- convolutional neural networks, cnns
- segmentation
- receptive fields, saliency maps
- recurrent neural networks
- LSTMs
- gated reccurrent units, GRUs
- transofrmers
- GANs
